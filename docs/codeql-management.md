# CodeQL Management Notes

The steps below explain how to keep the repository's CodeQL analysis constrained to the explicit workflow defined in `.github/workflows/codeql.yml` and avoid conflicts with GitHub's default CodeQL configuration.

## Disable the Default CodeQL Setup

1. Open the repository in GitHub and navigate to **Settings → Security → Code security and analysis → Code scanning**.
2. Under **Default setup**, choose **CodeQL** and select **Disable** to remove the automatic configuration that GitHub enables by default.
3. Confirm the dialog so that only custom workflows remain active.

> **Why**: The repository already provides a tailored workflow (`.github/workflows/codeql.yml`) that uploads SARIF results. Running the default setup in parallel can cause duplicate or conflicting uploads.

## Confirm the Custom Workflow is the Only CodeQL Definition

1. Verify that `.github/workflows/codeql.yml` is the only workflow referencing the `github/codeql-action` reusable actions.
2. Ensure no additional workflow files (e.g., generated by the default setup) exist under `.github/workflows/`.
3. When inspecting pull requests, only the "CodeQL" workflow defined in this repository should appear.

## Re-run the CodeQL Workflow After Changes

1. From the **Actions** tab, select the **CodeQL** workflow.
2. Use **Run workflow** (or push a commit/PR) to trigger a fresh run once the default setup has been disabled.
3. Confirm that the latest run reaches the "Upload SARIF" step without reporting conflicts about multiple configurations.

Following these steps ensures that CodeQL analysis remains consistent and avoids the default setup overriding or duplicating results from the repository's managed workflow.
